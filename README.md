## 🌍 Mission Brief

You’re controlling a robotic rover deployed on a plateau on Mars. The plateau is a 2D grid where:
- You land the rover at a specific coordinate and orientation.
- You provide a string of movement commands.
- The rover explores based on the commands and returns its final location.
- There are two rovers, so you first inform the position of the first one, and after for the second rover. 
- The point position is based on N - North, S - South, E - East and W - West.
